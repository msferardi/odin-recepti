im doing an Odin project task for which im supposed to create a website with recipes and links to them. If youre wondering how i got here, it's because i created a new repository on github, coppied the SSH key and ran the git clone SSH command in the Git command prompt. that enabled me to clone the repository to my local machine, even though it was empty and without content. After it was cloned, i opened it with VS Code and now im writing a Readme file.
